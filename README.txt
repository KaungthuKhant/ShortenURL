This is a stable version before I start updating. 
I have tested this version and it works as of Aug 28. 

To run this program you need to open a new terminal and enter "npm run devStart"
This will start the server.js and you can access the website at http://localhost:8800/


Features
==============================================================================================
Register works
Login works
Shorten url works
You can also add abbreviation to the shortened url instead of the randomly generated key


Currently, there is no timeout for the user so when the user login, even if they leave the tab open for 1 hour, they are still logged in
I want the website to kick them out and reconfirm they are logged in. 
I though I already worked on that one.
I might have to change that in the next version.
